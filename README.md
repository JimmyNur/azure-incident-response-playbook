## 🎯 Objective
Detect and respond to public Blob storage access in Azure using native tools and automation.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Azure Defender for Storage**: Provides security alerts for Blob storage.
- **Azure Monitor & Sentinel**: For monitoring and logging.
- **Azure Logic Apps + Functions**: For automation.
- **PowerShell**: For simulations.

## 🧠 Why This Matters
Publicly exposed blob containers are among the most exploited misconfigurations in Azure. This playbook simulates a breach and shows how to contain it quickly.

## 💥 Outcome
✔️ Real-time alert on blob misconfiguration  
✔️ Automated remediation using Logic Apps or Azure Functions  
✔️ SIEM logging into Sentinel with threat tags  

## 🔬 Real-World Scenario
This playbook automates alert responses via a Logic App, triggered by a security alert or manual HTTP request, which sends an email to the security team detailing the incident.

## ⚙️ Azure Logic App: Automated Alert Response

This Logic App is triggered by a security alert (or manual HTTP trigger) and automatically sends an email to the security team with details of the incident.

- Email Notification: Configured via shared mailbox in Azure
- Trigger: HTTP Request (simulating alert system)

# 🔍 Public Blob Misconfiguration – Real-World Simulation

## 🧪 Goal
Simulate a real-world cloud security breach caused by misconfigured Azure Blob storage and demonstrate automated incident response.

## 💣 Breach Steps
1. Created a blob container with public read access
2. Uploaded a file simulating sensitive internal data
3. Accessed the blob anonymously via direct URL
4. Triggered Logic App via HTTP or alert simulation
5. Auto-remediation: removed public access + email notification sent

## ✅ Success Indicators
- Logic App fired immediately
- Access to the blob revoked
- Email received with breach info

## 📌 Lessons Learned
Misconfigurations are still the biggest real-world cloud risk. This workflow proves response time can be reduced to seconds through automation.
